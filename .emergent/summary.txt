<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user provided a zip file () and requested to integrate it into the project one-to-one without any changes.
Later, the user requested the following changes:
1.  On the main search bar, remove Avtobus (Bus), Maşın icarəsi (Car Rental), and Transfer. Only Təyyarə bileti (Flight Ticket), Otel (Hotel), and Tour should be visible.
2.  Implement mock functionality for the flight search:
    *   Nereden (From) and Nereye (To) dropdowns should be populated with mock city data.
    *   Clicking Ucuz bilet ara (Find Cheap Ticket) should display a list of sample flight results.
3.  The flight search results page design should be updated to match an image provided by the user.
4.  When a user clicks the Seç (Select) button on a flight result, they should be redirected to a Checkout page. This page should include a passenger information form, a flight summary, and a payment button.

**User's preferred language**: Türkçe (Turkish)

**what currently exists?**
The project is a frontend-only application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The main page features a search component with three tabs: Uçak Bileti (Flight Ticket), Otel (Hotel), and Tur (Tour). The flight ticket search is functional with mock data. Users can select mock departure and arrival cities, search, and view a list of mock flight results. The results page is styled according to a user-provided design, featuring a filter sidebar and detailed flight information cards. The entire application is based on a project provided by the user in a zip file. There is no backend or database; all data is hardcoded in the frontend.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user requested the implementation of a checkout flow. When the Seç (Select) button on a flight result is clicked, the application should navigate to a new Checkout page. This page needs to have a passenger details form, a flight summary, and a payment button. The agent acknowledged the request and was about to start implementation by inspecting the existing code.
- Status: NOT STARTED

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues or bugs. The work is focused on new feature development.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
-   **P0: Implement Checkout Page Flow**
    -   Create a new route for  in .
    -   Create a new page component, .
    -   The  component should contain:
        -   A form for passenger information (e.g., name, surname, email).
        -   A section to display the summary of the selected flight.
        -   A button for payment (e.g., Ödeme Yap).
    -   Update  to handle the Seç button click. On click, it should navigate to the  page and pass the selected flight's data, likely using route state.

Future Tasks:
-   **P1: Implement Otel and Tour tabs:** Currently, these tabs are just UI elements. They need to be connected to their respective search forms and result displays.
-   **P2: Backend Integration:** Replace all mock data (cities, flights) with real data by creating and connecting to a backend API.
-   **P2: Payment Integration:** Implement actual payment processing logic for the payment button on the checkout page (e.g., using Stripe or another payment gateway).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Vite Project Integration:** Migrated the initial project structure to a Vite + React + TypeScript setup based on the code from the user-provided .
- **Search Tab Modification:** Updated the main page search bar in  to only show Uçak Bileti, Otel, and Tour tabs, as requested.
- **Mock Flight Search:** Implemented a full mock flight search flow in :
    -   Added 'From' and 'To' dropdowns with hardcoded city data.
    -   On search, a list of sample flight results is displayed on the same page.
- **Flight Results Redesign:** Completely redesigned the flight results section to match a user-provided image, including a filter sidebar, sort options, and detailed flight cards with logos, flight details, baggage info, and price.
- **i18n Updates:** Added new Turkish, English, and Russian translations to  for the new UI elements.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
-   **Routing:** 
-   **State Management:** React  and  for component-level state and language settings.
-   **Internationalization (i18n):** A basic context-based system for TR, EN, and RU languages.

**key DB schema**
-   None. The application is frontend-only and uses hardcoded mock data.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The initial Create React App (CRA) starter was completely replaced with a Vite + TypeScript + React stack to match the user's provided project.

**All files of reference**
-   : This is the most important file. It contains the logic for the search tabs, the flight search form, and the rendering of mock flight results. This file will need to be modified to handle the navigation to the checkout page.
-   : The main application component that sets up routing. It will need to be updated to include the new  route.
-   : Manages translations for the application.
-   : The main page that renders the .

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The  component is becoming very large and handles multiple responsibilities (search form, tabs, results display). The flight results rendering logic could be extracted into a separate, dedicated component to improve maintainability.
-   All data is hardcoded. The component should be refactored to accept data via props and eventually fetch it from an API.

**key api endpoints**
-   None.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   You MUST respond to the user in **Turkish (Türkçe)**.
-   The entire application currently runs on **mock data** hardcoded in the frontend. There is no backend or database connection.
-   The immediate next task is to create the checkout page and the navigation flow from the flight results Seç button.
-   The user prefers to see visual progress and provides iterative feedback. Use screenshots to confirm UI changes.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** When I say select the results that appear, I want it to direct me to the Checkout page. There, let them enter the passenger information, see the selection summary, and have a button to make a payment. **Status: NOT STARTED**
2.  **User:** (Shared an image of the desired flight results layout) **Status: COMPLETED**
3.  **User:** I want the results to look like this in the flight search section. **Status: COMPLETED**

9.  **User:** (uploaded zip file). **Status: COMPLETED**
10. **User:** Integrate this file here without interruption. Let everything be the same. Don't change anything. **Status: COMPLETED**

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** None
-   **Mocked:** The entire data layer is mocked. This includes city lists for dropdowns and flight search results.

-    (for icons)
-    (for client-side routing)
-    &  (for internationalization)

**Testing status**
-   Testing agent used after significant changes: YES
-   Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
-   Test files created: []
-   Known regressions: []

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   No credentials are required. The application is self-contained and uses mock data.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   Nothing. The agent successfully completed all prior user requests and was about to begin the latest one.</analysis>
